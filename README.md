### Programming with JavaScript

Description: https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-with-javascript

Certificate: <span style="color: red">Not yet issued</span>

<details>
  <summary>Learnings</summary>
  
  - Programming languages
    - High-level languages (human languages) and low-level languages (machine languages, binary code), memory
  - JavaScript
    - TypeScript (strongly-typed JavaScript) compiles down to JavaScript, Node.js on the server, jQuery library for cross-browser compatibility, React for dynamic websites
    - Variables
      - Data types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `BigInt`, `symbol`), operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical), comparison of value (`==`) vs. value and data type (`===`), concatenation through coercion (`string` type takes precedence), accumulation operator (`+=`)
    - Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript outside the browser, in command lines and on servers
  - Conditionals (flow control) and Loops
    - Conditional statements (`if`, `if {...} else {...}`, `else if {...}`, `switch`)
      - Switch statements are useful when there are many possible values for the same variable, and they can have a default (`else`) or be exhaustive (covering all possible conditions)
    - Loops (`for`, `while`, `nested`), counters (`i` for iterator)
      - `for` loop
        - Conditions: value (`var i=0`), count (`i<n` which can be any comparison), incrementor (`i++` which is synonymous with `i += 1`)
        - Body: `{...}`
      - `while` loop
        - Conditions: count (`i<n`)
        - Body: `{...}`
        - Value is declared before loop, and incrementor is declared within loop
      - Nested loops
        - Outer loop typically uses variable `i` while inner loop uses variable `j`
