- JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript, used by React to describe how the UI should look
  - Looks like HTML but is an abstraction combining markup and business logic into a "component"
    - The UI in React is structured into a tree of components
    - React produces pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from its JSX components
  - An "element" in React is a JavaScript object that describes the hierarchy of HTML output as a plaint object
    - Similar to the component tree hierarchy, but each node represents a plain object describing a component instance or DOM node and its desired properties
    - The main attributes are `type` for the HTML element type and `props` for the passed properties (attributes) (including `children`)
      - The `type` can also be a function corresponding to a React component rather than an HTML element type such as `<button>`
        - React identifies the components in the JSX tree and converts them to DOM elements, and this allows the mixing of components and HTML elements, resulting in the virtual DOM (JavaScript representation of the real DOM)
    - When re-rendering the UI, React's "diffing" operation compares the new JSX tree to the previous JSX tree, calculates the difference between the versions, and then applies the minimum changes necessary for implementing the update
- React's composition model provides two key features: "containment" and "specialization"
  - "Containment" refers to components that are generic because they do not know what `children` will be contained within them
  - "Specialization" refers to components that are special cases of othe components, such as a button component that is a special case of a generic button component
- There are serveral types that can be passed to the `children` prop of a JSX expression
  - String literals can be passed but JSX will remove: leading and trailing whitespaces, lines adjacent to tags, and newlines inside the string
  - JSX elements such as `<div>` can be passed
  - React fragments (`<React.Fragment>` or `<>`) can wrap children
    - This is useful when returning multiple JSX elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM
  - JavaScript expressions can be passed by wrapping in curly brackets (`<div>{''}</div>`)
  - Functions can be passed, in which case they will function like any other prop
  - Booleans, Null and Undefined can be passed but will be ignored
- React can be imported in a .js file as a whole global object with `import React from 'react'` or individual functions as a named import with `import { functionName } from 'react'`
- The `children` prop in a React component can be dynamically transformed
  - The `React.cloneElement(element, [props])` top-level API clones a React element into a copy, where `element` is the element and `[props]` is any new props that will be merged into existing props on the element
    - Useful for modifying children properties, adding to children properties, or extending functionality of children components
  - The `React.Children` top-level API provides utilities for dealing with transformation of the children prop structure (such as `.map()`)
- As `props` is an object, an object can be declared instead of declaring `props` as the argument for a functional component (`const ComponentName = ({ children }) => {}`)
- The "spread operator" (`...`) can copy an object (such as `props`) by spreading the properties with `...objectName`
  - This can be leveraged to copy and then update properties when instantiating a new object with `{ ...objectName, propertyName: value }`
  - React provides a pattern for using the spread operator for declaration of element attributes, such that `<ElementName attributeName={value}>` can be `<ElementName {...objectName}>` where the object has the same properties as would be declared as attributes
    - Additional attributes can be declared as normal, which enables specification through componentization
    - The order of the attributes declaration determines whether the spread operator overrides other attributes
