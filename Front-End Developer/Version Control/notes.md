- Version control is a system that records and tracks file changes
  - Provides access to history
  - Provides ability to revert changes and roll back to previous version
  - Files can be added, modified, and removed
  - Files have a revision history, identity
  - Benefits include revision history, identity, collaboration, automation and efficiency
    - Revision history provides a date for changes and way to roll back to an older version or revert specific changes (who, when, and what)
    - Identity shows who is responsible for making or approving a change
    - Collaboration is improved by tracking which changes have been made relative to the plan for which changes need to be made
      - Code is peer reviewed when it is ready to be implemented
    - Efficiency is achieved through an agile approach to development, wherein iterations of changes are planned for sprints of i.e. 2 weeks and then reviewed and the plan continously reassessed
  - DevOps (Developer Operations) is a set of practices, philopsohies and tools that increase the ability to deliver applications in high quality and velocity
- Types of version control systmems
  - Centralized systems (VCS) use a client-server model where the server has the source version of a project and the client versions are clones that require all changes to contact the server
  - Distributed systems (DVCS) use a client-server model where both the server and client have the source version of a project and changes can be made to the client and then pushed to the server later
- Workflows for version control
  - Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automating integration of code changes by automatically compiling the project source code and running tests to guard against merge conflicts 
  - Continuous Delivery is an extension of CI whereby compiled project source code is also automatically packaged and delivered
  - Continuous Deployment is an extension of Continuous Delivery whereby packaged code is deployed and tested in a safe environment before being delivered to the release environment
- Development environments are commonly: developer, test, quality assurance, staging, production
  - The staging environment should match production but be separate and can be created using snapshots of the production environment
    - Useful for new feature rollout, testing, migrations, configuration
  - The production environment is live meaning it is used by users
    - If rollouts to production have not been througougly tested they can cause downtime which affects revenue, create security vulnerabilities, and damage the reputation of the company
- The command line provides text-based human-computer interaction
  - Unix commands
    - `cd [folder name]` changes directory
      - Folder names can be provided as a relative path from the current directory or an absolute path from the disk
    - `cd ..` changes directory to parent of current folder
    - `ls` ouputs the contents of the current directory
    - `touch [file name].[file extension]` creates a new empty file
    - `mv [file name] [folder name]` moves a file in the current directory to another directory
    - `mkdir [folder name]` creates a new empty folder
    - `history` ouputs the history of recently used commands
    - `man [command]` ouputs the manual for the given command
    - Flags modify commands to provide input or output a value such as `[command] --help` for instructions
    - Pipe (`[command] | [command]`) makes it possible to pass the output of a command as input to another command
      - Example "Combined word count in two text files": `cat [file name] [file name] | wc -w`
    - Redirection of output redirects it directly to a target
      - Standard input (`[output target] < [input source]`)
      - Standard output (`[input source] > [output target]`)
      - Standard error (`[input source] 2> [output target]`)
      - Standard output and error (`[input source] > [output target] 2>&1`)
    - Grep (global regular expression print) searches a text file for regular expression matches (`grep [expression] [file name]`)
      - `grep -i [expression] [filename]` ignores case sensitivity
      - `grep -w [expression] [filename]` outputs an exact match
      - This can be combined with `ls` to filter directory files with `ls [directory name] | grep [expression]`
- Git
  - Commands
    - `git blame` ouputs the identity of who made a change
