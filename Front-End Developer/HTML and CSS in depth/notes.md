- HTML is a document describing structured information
  - Semantic tags describe content such that it is searchable and accessible (to screen readers)
    - Basic HTML tags like `<h1>` are semantic
    - Non-formatting semantic tags include `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>` etc.
      - It is common to provide `<header>` links wrapped in an unordered list `<ul>`
      - The `<article>` tag is used for "complete, self-contained, and independently distributable" information
        - The `<header>` and `<main>` tags should be used within `<article>`
        - The `<section>` tag can be used within the `<main>` tag nested in `<article>`
          - A heading tag like `<h1>` should be used within `<section>`
  - Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of improving search results for a website through changes to content, semantics and delivery
    - Search engines analyze the content and semantics of a website as well as any websites referenced through `href` and rank the result
  - Meta tags define metadata (data about other data) about a webpage
    - Adding `alt` attributes to `<img>` tags help both with accessibility and SEO ranking
    - Metadata is added in the `<header>` with `<meta>` tags containing the attributes `name` and `content`
      - `name` is the type of metadata, and can be any string but should ideally meet a standard
        - The `name="robots"` type can be used in conjuction with comma-delimited content to instruct search engines and bots on what content to index/follow or not index/follow
          - The `name="googlebot"` type can be used for Google with content such as `"notranslate"` to disable translation
        - The `name="viewport"` type can be used to provide a responsive device-based design and improve the SEO ranking
        - The `name="keyword"` type should NOT be used as one major search engine labels these webpages as spam
      - `content` is the value for the type of metadata
      - `<meta charset="UTF-8">` sets the encoding for the webpage
      - `<meta http-equiv="">` simulates HTTP response headers
    - Facebook's Open Graph Protocol standardizes the use of metadata to provide information to link previews
      - Meta tags use the `property` attribute instead of `name` and each type starts with "og:" such as `property="og:image"` for the image preview of the website link
        - The `property="og:type"` attribute is important because it identifies the category of the link
      - Before this standard, and when it's not used, web crawlers will pick the most likely information and media to use in the link preview
  - User input
    - Forms are created using the `<form>` tag
      - The `action` attribute of `<form>` sets a value referencing the URL path for the web server
        - When the value is not provided, it defaults to the current web address
        - The value is appended to the current web address when it is an absolute path such as `/login` or relative path such as `login`, instead of a full URL starting with `http://` or `https://`
      - Forms submit data as a HTTP request from the client to a server, utilizing the method defined as the value of the form's `method` attribute, either `method="get"` or `method="post"`
        - The HTTP `"get"` method (default) embeds data in a URL which has three issues: URL length limit in browsers causing data loss, URL length limit on web server causing data loss, security threats as a result of insecure unecrypted data in the URL
        - The HTTP `"post"` method embeds data unencrypted in the body of the content of the request
        - HTTPS encrypts data while allowing both the client and web server to decrypt data
    - Inputs are added to forms using the `<input>` tag
      - Inputs can be placed inside `<div>` tags such that they are rendered on new lines
      - Inputs should have an `id` and `name`
        - Ids and names would typically have the structure of "object_purpose" where object is the overall form and purpose is the purpose of the data in each individual input such as "user_email" for an input email in a user login form
        - Ids are unique but names can be reused for multiple input tags of the same purpose
        - `<label>` is adding to an input by providing a value to its `for` attribute with a value corresponding to the input, such as `<label for="password">` for `<input type="password" id="password" name="password">`
        - Labels help assistive technology such as screenreaders understand the meaning of form inputs
      - Labels should be added for input types such as `text`
      - The `reset` type for `<input>` resets all inputs in a form to their initial value, but this would not reset validation errors if the initial state is not a valid submission
      - Radio buttons provide a list of options from which one option can be chosen
        - A group of radio buttons are added to a `<fieldset>` elements with an `id` attribute value describing the purpose of the buttons such as `<fieldset id="size">` for size options
        - Radio buttons are `<input>` elements with `type="radio"`
          - The `value` attribute is used to set the predefined value
          - The `checked` attribute sets a radio button as the default choice
          - The `name` attribute should have a value matching the id of its parent `<fieldset>`
        - Radio buttons can be nested inside a `<label>` in addition to `<fieldset>` to improve mobile user experience
      - Interactive form elements help the user input data
        - The `date` type for `<input` renders a structured input field for correctly entering dates
        - The `range` type for `<input>` renders a slider between to values set with the `min` and `max` attributes, where default value is set with the `value` attribute
          - The `<output>` tag can be used to render the result of an input tag
          - The `oninput` attribute of `<input>` can be used to execute a function upon change to the input value
            - The `oninput="this.nextElementSibling.value = this.value"` value would update the next element, such as `<output>` with the value of the input tag
        - The `<datalist>` tag can be used like radio buttons to provide a dropdown of predefined options, but it acts a textfield where the user can type to search options
          - The `<option>` tag provides an option in the dropdown list and has a `value` attribute
    - Form validation is a process that ensures input data is valid
      - Client-side validation checks for errors as they are typed, either done by browser of JavaScript code, before the data is submitted to the server
        - `<input` element type-tag values such as `type="email"` provide validation
        - The `required` attribute on `<input>` ensures data is provided by the user before the form can be submitted
        - The `minlength` and `maxlength` attributes on `<input>` ensure the length of input data is within the given constraints before it can be submitted to the server
        - The `hidden` type for `<input>` provides data upon submitting a form but is not visible to the user
        - The `multiple` attribute can be used for `email` and `file` type to permit multiple entries in the same input
        - The `pattern` attribute is used with a regular expression value to validate text, date, search, URL, tel, email and password input types
      - Server-side validation handles data submitted by the client to the server, to prevent tempering or invalid data, through complex checking against databases and business requirements
      - CSS pseudo-class selectors can be applied to `input` to style form inputs when input is invalid
        - `input:invalid` applies a style when data is invalid, but this will apply instantly when a `required` input is rendered
        - `input:focus:invalid` applies a style when data is invalid and an input is selected
    - As browsers and operating systems do not have a standard for rendering forms, CSS can be utilized to prevent inconsistencies
  - Media elements
    - The `<video>` tag can be used to render video
      - The `width` and `height` attributes control how the video is rendered
      - The `controls` attribute renders video player controls
      - The `<source>` tag is nested inside `<video>` with the attribute `src` and `type`
        - The `src` attribute should have a value corresponding to the video path
        - The `type` attribute shoudl have a value corresponding to the file type `"video/mp4"`, `"video/ogg"` or `"video/webm"`
    - The `<audio>` tag can be used to play audio
      - The `controls` attribute renders audio player controls
      - The `<source>` tag is nested inside `<audio>` with the attribute `src` and `type`
        - The `src` attribute should have a value corresponding to the audio path
        - The `type` attribute shoudl have a value corresponding to the file type `"audio/mpeg"`, `"audio/wav"` or `"audio/ogg"`
    - The `<img>` tag can be used to render an image
      - The `width` and `height` attributes control how the image is rendered
        - If only the width or height is provided a value, the browser will automatically fill the other value using the image aspect ratio
      - The `src` attribute should have a value corresponding to the image path
      - The `alt` attribute should have a value representing a description of the image, which is used when the image can't load or for accessibility screen readers
      - A parent `<figure>` tag can wrap `<img>` for greater accessibility, and a descriptive value in `<figcaption>` should be provided alongside `<img>`
    - The `<iframe>` tag embeds a HTML file in a HTML file, but its use is not recommended due to security risks
      - The `width` and `height` attributes control how the image is rendered
      - The `src` attribute should have a value corresponding to the HTML path
      - The `allow` attribute restricts the embedded HTML from accessing certain features, such as `allow="camera 'none'; microphone 'none'"`
      - The `sandbox` attribute declared with no value places restrictions on the embedded HTML, and specifying a value will lift the declared restrictions such as allowing file downloads or popup windows
    - The `<canvas>` tag supports 2D animations and games
      - The `document.getElementById(canvasId).getContext("2d")` JavaScript object can be manipulated in order to animate the canvas element in the DOM
- CSS is a stylesheet language that compliments HTML by improving its look and layout
  - CSS can exist as a file separate from an HTML document
  - The "viewport" is what is rendered on the webpage
  - The `display` property controls if boxes are rendered inline or as a block
    - Flexboxes (`display: flex`) are one-dimensional layouts that can grow/shrink/align items, best for small-scale layouts
      - The `flex-direction` property can be set to either `row` or `column`, with row direction as default
      - The two axis are "main" (horizontal) and "cross" (vertical) in row direction
      - Alignment is set with the properties: `justify-content`, `align-items`, `align-self` and `align-content`
      - Items do not wrap to the next line by default but this can be set with the property-value `flex-wrap: wrap`
      - The `gap` property controls the spacing between items
      - The behavior of items is set with the properties: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`
        - The "shorthand notation" for these properties is `flex: 0 1 auto` for `flex-grow: 0; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: auto`
      - Flexboxes can be used to construct "flex charts" such as a bar chart
    - Grids (`display: grid`) are two-dimensional layouts, best for large-scale layouts
      - `grid-template-columns` property sets the size of the columns in the grid
        - A value such as `repeat(3, 100px)` should be used for responsive columns
      - `grid-template-rows` property sets the size of the rows in the grid
        - The fraction unit (`fr`) can be used to set a relative size such as `grid-template-rows: 2fr 1fr`
      - `grid-auto-rows` property sizes all rows to the same size
        - The value `minmax(150px, auto)` can be set to dynamically render either the minimum or maximum (in this case `auto`) size
      - `grid-gap`, `column-gap` and `row-gap` set the gap between columns/rows, columns and rows in a grid
      - Grid frameworks provide a grid system with units, where the maximum width is typically 12 or 16
        - `grid-column: 1/ span 12` would set the column width to span all 12 units in the grid system
    - `grid-template-areas` property sets the rows in the grid, and its value is a list of space-separated quotes where each quote contains the string names of elements present in the row and each element is a column
    - There are various units of measurements for absolute or relative sizing
      - The absolute units are `Q`, `mm`, `cm`, `in`, `pc`, `pt` and `px`
      - The relatve units are `em`, `ex`, `ch`, `rem`, `lh`, `rlh`, `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, `vmax`, `%`
        - Relative units are relative to their parent element or the viewport size
  - CSS rules are applied based on a "specificity hierarchy"
    - Highest specificity: Inline styles are applied over all other styling
    - IDs styling is second in prioritization
    - Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes styling is third in prioritization
    - Lowest specificity: Elements and pseudo-elements styling is applied last
  - CSS selectors selectively apply rulles to HTML elements
    - Element selectors apply based on the element tag (`body { }`)
    - ID selectors apply based on the ID attribute of an element (`#title { }`)
    - Class selectors apply based on the class attribute of an element (`.title { }`)
    - Attribute selectors apply based on the matching attribute or value of an element
      - Applying to elements with attribute: `t[a] { }` where `t` is the element tag and `a` is the attribute
      - Applying to elements with attribute value: `t[a*="s"] { }` where `t` is the element tag, `a` is the attribute, and `s` is a string matching part of the attribute value
      - Applying to elements with exact attribute value: `t[a="s"] { }` where `t` is the element tag, `a` is the attribute, and `s` is a string matching an exact attribute value
    - Nth-of-type selectors apply to the n-th child matching the given type inside the parent element (`p:nth-of-type(n) { }`)
    - Nth-child selectors apply to the n-th child of the parent element (`.menu:nth-child(n) { }`)
    - Star selectors apply to all children of the given element, which is the entire document by default (`* { }`)
    - Group selectors (selector stacking) apply to multiple comma-delimited selectors at once (`h1, p { }`)
    - Combination selectors apply to elements based on their relationship to each other
      - Descendant selectors apply to descendant elements of a parent element (`div h1 { }`)
      - Child selectors apply to direct descendant elements of the parent element (`div > h1 { }`)
      - General sibling selectors apply to all sibling elements of an element (`h1 ~ p { }`)
      - Adjacent sibling selectors apply to the first sibling element of an element (`h1 + p { }`)
    - Pseudo-classes are state-based selectors that apply based on the state of the element, such as hover-state (`div:hover { }`)
      - As pseudo-classes can overwrite each other, it is important to follow the "LVHA" order (link, visited, hover, active)
      - User action pseudo-classes apply based on user interaction with an element, such as `:hover` and `:active`
      - Form state pseudo-classes apply based on the state of an element in a form, such as `:disabled` / `:enabled`, `:checked` / `:indeterminate`, and `:valid` / `:invalid`
      - Position state pseudo-classes apply based on the position of an element relative to its parent, such as `:first-of-type`, `:last-of-type`, `:nth-of-type()` and `:nth-last-of-type()`
    - Pseudo-element selectors apply to part of an element (`p::first-letter { }`)
      - Text in elements can be styled using the pseudo-elements: `::first-letter`, ``::first-line``, ``::selection`` and ``::marker``
      - The pseudo-elements ``::before`` and ``::after`` can be used together with the `content` property to insert styled text before or after an element
  - CSS effects animate and transition elements from one state to another
    - Effects act as a content highlight, to they catch and maintain user attention
    - Effects can become distracting or cause slow performance if used erroneously
    - JavaScript libraries such as JQuery and Popmotion provide effects, but CSS effects are still popular because they are simpler, quicker, less expensive, and easier to learn
    - Common effects: hover effect, lightening/darkening, cursor effect, sliding galleries and slideshows, video backgrounds, parallax, scroll to top, element and color transitions, full screen snapping
    - Text effects added visual styles to text
      - Text can be styled with `text-overflow` and `word-wrap` when it overflows its container, with values such as `ellipses` (...) to hide text until you hover over it, `clip` which clips the text, and `break-word`
      - `text-shadow` property adds a shadow effect to text
    - The `transform` property modifies the spatial position of an element, such as scale or angle
    - The `transition` property sets the transition from one state to another state of an element, such as `transition: 2s` for a 2-second gradual transformation
    - The `animation` shorthand property is used to create complex animations, which are then executed by a keyframe rule
      - The syntax is `animation: ${keyframe name} ${speed} ${time duration} ${timing function}`
      - The individual `animation-` properties can be added in addition to this shorthand, for purposes such as timing, delay, direction, iteration count etc.
    - The `@keyframe rule` is an "at-rule" (describes behavior or performs action) that defines a name for an animation and controls its timing, using a keyframes-selector and css styles
      - The optional percentage keywords can be used for percentage-wise progress
        - The syntax is `@keyframes ${keyframe name} { 0% { } 100% { } }` and multiple percentages can be declared with any value
      - The optional keywords `from { }` and `to { }` can be used to transition an animation between two states
        - The syntax is `@keyframes ${keyframe name} { from { } to { } }`
  - CSS preprocessors such as SASS, SCSS, and Stylus, transpile from their own language down into CSS
    - Variables (`$name: value`) are an added feature in these preprocessors, which make it possible to declare a value once and reference throughout CSS code
    - Directives are an added feature that make it possible for one CSS rule declaration to be inherited by another CSS rule declaration, using the keywords `@mixin` before declaration and `@include ...` for reference
  - Fonts, Color, Layout, Size
  - Media queries
  - Box-sizing
  - Multiple backgrounds
  - Border images
- W3C manages the specifications for web standards like HTML and CSS
  - They added media tags, responsive design, form input tags, validation features, text editing and spellchecking
- Layouts commonly used for websites include top navigation bar layout, carousel layout, blog layout, dashboard layout
