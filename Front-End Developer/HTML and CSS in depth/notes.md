- HTML is a document describing structured information
  - Semantic tags describe content such that it is searchable and accessible (to screen readers)
    - Basic HTML tags like `<h1>` are semantic
    - Non-formatting semantic tags include `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>` etc.
      - It is common to provide `<header>` links wrapped in an unordered list `<ul>`
      - The `<article>` tag is used for "complete, self-contained, and independently distributable" information
        - The `<header>` and `<main>` tags should be used within `<article>`
        - The `<section>` tag can be used within the `<main>` tag nested in `<article>`
          - A heading tag like `<h1>` should be used within `<section>`
  - Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of improving search results for a website through changes to content, semantics and delivery
    - Search engines analyze the content and semantics of a website as well as any websites referenced through `href` and rank the result
  - Meta tags define metadata (data about other data) about a webpage
    - Adding `alt` attributes to `<img>` tags help both with accessibility and SEO ranking
    - Metadata is added in the `<header>` with `<meta>` tags containing the attributes `name` and `content`
      - `name` is the type of metadata, and can be any string but should ideally meet a standard
        - The `name="robots"` type can be used in conjuction with comma-delimited content to instruct search engines and bots on what content to index/follow or not index/follow
          - The `name="googlebot"` type can be used for Google with content such as `"notranslate"` to disable translation
        - The `name="viewport"` type can be used to provide a responsive device-based design and improve the SEO ranking
        - The `name="keyword"` type should NOT be used as one major search engine labels these webpages as spam
      - `content` is the value for the type of metadata
      - `<meta charset="UTF-8">` sets the encoding for the webpage
      - `<meta http-equiv="">` simulates HTTP response headers
    - Facebook's Open Graph Protocol standardizes the use of metadata to provide information to link previews
      - Meta tags use the `property` attribute instead of `name` and each type starts with "og:" such as `property="og:image"` for the image preview of the website link
        - The `property="og:type"` attribute is important because it identifies the category of the link
      - Before this standard, and when it's not used, web crawlers will pick the most likely information and media to use in the link preview
  - User input
    - Forms are created using the `<form>` tag
      - The `action` attribute of `<form>` sets a value referencing the URL path for the web server
        - When the value is not provided, it defaults to the current web address
        - The value is appended to the current web address when it is an absolute path such as `/login` or relative path such as `login`, instead of a full URL starting with `http://` or `https://`
      - Forms submit data as a HTTP request from the client to a server, utilizing the method defined as the value of the form's `method` attribute, either `method="get"` or `method="post"`
        - The HTTP `"get"` method (default) embeds data in a URL which has three issues: URL length limit in browsers causing data loss, URL length limit on web server causing data loss, security threats as a result of insecure unecrypted data in the URL
        - The HTTP `"post"` method embeds data unencrypted in the body of the content of the request
        - HTTPS encrypts data while allowing both the client and web server to decrypt data
    - Inputs are added to forms using the `<input>` tag
      - Inputs can be placed inside `<div>` tags such that they are rendered on new lines
      - Inputs should have an `id` and `name`
        - Ids and names would typically have the structure of "object_purpose" where object is the overall form and purpose is the purpose of the data in each individual input such as "user_email" for an input email in a user login form
        - Ids are unique but names can be reused for multiple input tags of the same purpose
        - `<label>` is adding to an input by providing a value to its `for` attribute with a value corresponding to the input, such as `<label for="password">` for `<input type="password" id="password" name="password">`
        - Labels help assistive technology such as screenreaders understand the meaning of form inputs
      - Labels should be added for input types such as `text`
      - The `reset` type for `<input>` resets all inputs in a form to their initial value, but this would not reset validation errors if the initial state is not a valid submission
      - Radio buttons provide a list of options from which one option can be chosen
        - A group of radio buttons are added to a `<fieldset>` elements with an `id` attribute value describing the purpose of the buttons such as `<fieldset id="size">` for size options
        - Radio buttons are `<input>` elements with `type="radio"`
          - The `value` attribute is used to set the predefined value
          - The `checked` attribute sets a radio button as the default choice
          - The `name` attribute should have a value matching the id of its parent `<fieldset>`
        - Radio buttons can be nested inside a `<label>` in addition to `<fieldset>` to improve mobile user experience
      - Interactive form elements help the user input data
        - The `date` type for `<input` renders a structured input field for correctly entering dates
        - The `range` type for `<input>` renders a slider between to values set with the `min` and `max` attributes, where default value is set with the `value` attribute
          - The `<output>` tag can be used to render the result of an input tag
          - The `oninput` attribute of `<input>` can be used to execute a function upon change to the input value
            - The `oninput="this.nextElementSibling.value = this.value"` value would update the next element, such as `<output>` with the value of the input tag
        - The `<datalist>` tag can be used like radio buttons to provide a dropdown of predefined options, but it acts a textfield where the user can type to search options
          - The `<option>` tag provides an option in the dropdown list and has a `value` attribute
    - Form validation is a process that ensures input data is valid
      - Client-side validation checks for errors as they are typed, either done by browser of JavaScript code, before the data is submitted to the server
        - `<input` element type-tag values such as `type="email"` provide validation
        - The `required` attribute on `<input>` ensures data is provided by the user before the form can be submitted
        - The `minlength` and `maxlength` attributes on `<input>` ensure the length of input data is within the given constraints before it can be submitted to the server
        - The `hidden` type for `<input>` provides data upon submitting a form but is not visible to the user
        - The `multiple` attribute can be used for `email` and `file` type to permit multiple entries in the same input
        - The `pattern` attribute is used with a regular expression value to validate text, date, search, URL, tel, email and password input types
      - Server-side validation handles data submitted by the client to the server, to prevent tempering or invalid data, through complex checking against databases and business requirements
      - CSS pseduo-class selectors can be applied to `input` to style form inputs when input is invalid
        - `input:invalid` applies a style when data is invalid, but this will apply instantly when a `required` input is rendered
        - `input:focus:invalid` applies a style when data is invalid and an input is selected
    - As browsers and operating systems do not have a standard for rendering forms, CSS can be utilized to prevent inconsistencies
  - Media elements
- CSS is a stylesheet language that compliments HTML by improving its look and layout
  - Can exist separatedly from an HTML document
  - Media queries
  - Box-sizing
  - Multiple backgrounds
  - Border images
  - Text shadows
  - Transformations and transitions
- W3C manages the specifications for web standards like HTML and CSS
  - They added media tags, responsive design, form input tags, validation features, text editing and spellchecking
- Layouts commonly used for websites include top navigation bar layout, carousel layout, blog layout, dashboard layout
