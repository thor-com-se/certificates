- Design is subjective but can be evaluated and ideated early on through guidelines and evaluation methods
  - Dieter Rams' "10 principles of good design"
    - "Innovative" means should should make a change or do something in a new way, introducing new methods, ideas, products
    - "Useful" means design should complement and emphasize the usefulness of a product and foremost be functional
    - "Aesthetic" means design should be joyous and beautiful
    - "Understandable" means design should communicate its intent and the possibilities for interaction
    - "Unobtrusive" means design should complement the utility of a product and not be obtrusive to its use
    - "Honest" means design should be integral and not promise to be something it is not
    - "Long-lasting" means design should be timeless and users should want to keep it
    - "Thorough down to the last detail" means design should be thorough as this encourages a culture of quality that comes through in the final product
    - "Environmentally-friendly" means design should be sustainable so that it can continue to be good in the future
    - "As little design as possible" means design should provide the most value with the least design, letting the design breathe instead of becoming cluttered
  - Jacob Nielsen's "heuristic evaluation" is a method for finding usability flaws in a design by judging it relative to known principles for easy-to-use design such as the "usability heuristics"
    - "Visibility of system status" means design should indicate to the user its state and current operation, such as a computer program that processes and changes state
    - "Match between the system and the real world" means design should be familiar and based on previous experiences that it is assumed users may have had
    - "User control and freedom" means design provides a quick way to undo any mistakes
    - "Consistency and standards" means design should be consistent across an experience
    - "Error prevention" means design should prevent errors before they happen rather than just providing feedback on errors
    - "Recognition rather than recall" means design should display information with recognizable intent and now just something the user has to remember or recall, with hints indicating time-sensitivity or process state changes
    - "Flexibility and efficiency of use" means design should accomodate both new users while also allowing experienced users with shortcuts that make actions quick and efficient
    - "Aesthetic and minimalistic design" means deisgn is noticed first for its visual appeal and this helps reinforce brand identity and credibility
    - "Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors" means design should provide error communication that is polite, easy to understand, precise, constructive, clearly visible, and brief
    - "Help and documentation" means design should be useable without documentation but still provide additional information that is easy to find, focused on the user's task and include the steps needed
  - Ben Schneiderman's "Schneiderman evaluation"/"8 golden rules for interface design"
    - "Strive for consistency" means design should be consistent as to establish credibility and identity
    - "Enable frequent users to use shortcuts" means design should enable greater efficiency through optional shortcuts
    - "Offer informative feedback" means design should provide feedback as soon as possible so users can best understand the system
    - "Design dialog to yield closure" means design should have a clearly defined and communicated beginning, middle, and end
    - "Offer simple error handling" means design should eliminate potential errors to the greatest extent, and provide informative feedback and choices when errors are encountered
    - "Permit easy reversal of actions" means design should make it possible and obvious how to undo an action
    - "Support internal locus of control" means design should wait for users to initiate actions, and avoid surprises and interruptions, such that users feel free and in control of the system
    - "Reduce short-term memory load" means design should accomodate user attention spans by preferring recognizable information over recalling information
- Designing for accessibility enables people with disabilities to interpret, understand, navigate, interact with and contribute to a product
  - Accessibility guidelines exist for guiding the design direction, such as Section 508 and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0
  - Accessibility provides design constraints for guiding accessible design, but it should not be a barrier to innovation or restrict possibilities
  - Peers should not be used when designing for accessibility, as they are unlikely to be vastly different from the designer
  - Color is used to convey information about status and intent, but using color alone makes the design inaccessible to colorblind users
  - The WCAG recommends a constrast ratio between foreground text and background of at least 4.5 to 1 to accomodate for low vision users
  - Interactive elements should be easily identifiable using distinct styles, and navigatable both with and without a mouse as some users can only use a keyboard
    - A highlight can be used to indicate which interactive element can currently be interacted with using the keyboard
  - Forms should have descriptive labels associated with each input field
  - Navigation across website pages should be consistent and more than one way of navigating can be provided through site search or site maps
    - Orientation cues such as breadcrumbs and clear headings can help users understand where and why they are on a page
  - Interaction feedback messages and instructions should be easily visible
  - Whitespace helps separate content and headings and spacing help group related content
  - Desinging for different viewport sizes such as mobile phones or zoomed browser windows helps ensure anyone can access the content
  - Content that automatically plays should provide controls
- Form design influences user perception and conversion (from user to customer) of a website
  - Forms, such as web forms, should facilitate users entering and submitting information
    - Layout, format, UX, appearance are factors in determining the quality of a form
    - Form fields should be spaced out using logical grouping, such that it is indentifiable which labels belong to which unique field based on proximity of the label to the field
  - Best practices for good form design
    - Use a single-column layout as it is easier to understand
    - Label the form with a title and description indicating what happens on submit
    - Sort form fields from simplest to most difficult, as users are more likely to be retained if the easiest steps are presented first
    - Inline form validation should be used to display error messages below or inside the individual form field
    - Align text (including queries and labels) to the left, as it reduces time needed to fill out the form
    - Do not request mandatory phone numbers unless the users would perceive it as necessary
    - Use form fields that browsers can auto-fill with known data such as first and last name
    - Forms should be mobile-friendly by fitting to different screen sizes
    - Error messages should be positive and concise on how to make a correction and should never blame the user
      - Passwords typically have to consist of a mix of different characters, and an error message should indicate when these criteria are not met
    - Smart default should be enabled, to use information like user's current location to instantly improve speed of completion process
    - Progress bars can be used for long forms, to indicate how much remains of the form
      - Users can see where they are in the flow and go back to review previously filled out form fields
    - reCAPTCHAs (image questions) should be used in place of CAPTCHAs (text questions) to maintain security while making it easier for users to complete
    - Keyboard shortcuts should be supported, such as Tab to move the active form field to the following form field
  - Reusable UI "components" and "design systems" provide a systematic, consistent and aesthetically pleasing user interface
    - "Design guidelines" reflect the underlying values of the brand
    - "Design pattern library" is a collection of accepted and widely used design patterns in a central repository
      - A "pattern" is a recurrence of multiple design elements that collaborate with one another
    - "UI kit" / "component library" consists of components such as buttons and widgets
    - "Process design guidelines" is a collection of accepted and widely used patterns such as a design pattern library
      - Assists designers in interpreting design principles during a task
