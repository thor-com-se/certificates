- UX and UI design are human-centered disciplines
- A lack of UX principles applied to UI design can create extra cognitive load on users
- Producer designers think holistically about problems
  - They question why products are made and who they serve
  - Designers are not users, so it's important to talk to users, emphasize with users, and to question assumptions about users
  - Collaboration between designers and developers helps both understand and weigh the consequences of an implementation and alternative solutions
- The role of types of designers varies between companies
  - In the Little Lemon example, the UX is the questions asked about customers
    - What do they need?
      - What stops them from getting it?
    - How intuitive is the website?
    - Can they go from one section to another quickly and efficiently?
  - In the Little Lemon example, the UI is what the users see
    - The website and its elements are the primary destination
      - Types, colors, buttons, shapes, icons, images
      - Elements should be grouped and assembled correctly
      - Users should be helped to achieve their goals
      - Should adhere to the brand
  - UX designers can perform user research and produce prototypes to iteratively make suggestions
  - UI designers create logical and beautiful layouts, informed by a systemized design library
  - Designers in small companies may need to perform several roles covering both UX and AI, but as the company size increases designers become more specialized and perform more niche roles
- Product managers handle communication between roles and teams, and the strategy necessary for succeeding in product development
- "UX" (User Experience) was coined by Don Norman to describe the experience of purchasing from a store
  - UX has been refined into an iterative design process
    - Observing a task performed by users
    - Identifying user problems
    - Generating ideas for how to solve problems
    - Prototyping an implementation
    - Testing the solution
  - The standard process is emphasize, define, idea, prototype, test
  - "Usability" is an essential UX concept to gauge how easy and intuitive a product is to use
    - Jacob Nielsen proposes five "usability components"
      - "Learnability" means easy to learn from the first time
      - "Efficiency" means quick and efficient to do and flexible to changes in user decision
      - "Memorability" means remembering and finding what was being done, as users can get distracted
      - "Errors" means providing solutions to mistakes and addressing them when they happen
      - "Satisfaction" means being pleasant, enjoyable and even satisfying to use, making users want to do something
  - "UX goals" can be organized into aspects that are desirable or undesirable to users
    - Desirable design could be enjoyable, fun, relaxing, satisfying, efficient, intuitive, with the user engaged, motivated, and stimulated
    - Undesirable design could be slow, confusing, complicated, which makes the users bored, frustrated, and stressed
  - "UX artifacts" are documents used by design teams to gather, organize and present information throughout the UX process
    - "User personas" are models/characters portraying a user, and are used during user experience research by product teams to ensure a fit between the designed product and the needs and requirements of end users
      - User research informs the process of determining the potential types of users
        - Interviewing customers (at least five people) until there is nothing more to learn
        - Assumptions about customers can be made once there is a reasonable about of information
        - Web analytics tools gather quantitative data that indicates how customers behave, and can be used in conjunction with information about why customers behave and what motivates them
      - Personas can be varied across age group, sociometric position etc.
      - Developing multiple varied user personas helps ensure a broad product fit
    - "Persona groups" are collections of similar personas than then become consolidated into "single-user personas"
      - The contents of this consolidated person can be a fictional name, image, demographic profile, summarizing quote about what matters to them, personal background, mini-biography, psychological profile of user needs, interests, motivaitons and pain points
    - "Empathy maps" consist of 4 quadarants that describe what a persona says, thinks, does and feels
    - "User stories" are brief statements/abstracts describing users, user needs/goals, to establish who the user is, what they require and why they require it
      - Each user persona typically has one user story
      - The template is "As a `[type of user]`, I want `[a goal]` for `[some reason]`"
        - Type of user is the end-user or user role
        - A goal is the action taken by the user
        - Some reason is the outcome or desired value expected by the user for the action performed
    - "Scenarios" are situationens depicting user interaction, and they describe the user's motivations for doing the task/goal and a question they need answered, and they suggest possible ways to achieve goals
      - Essentailly an extension of the user story
      - Can be divided into "use cases" which describe sequence of user tasks in a provided functionality/path
      - Aid the design team in imagining the ideal solution to a user problem
      - "Scenario mapping" is the first step in scenario planning, where designers, developers and product owners meet to discuss ideas and design a plan centered on a user persona, to define a critical task for the user to achieve
        - This is followed by a scenario analysis, contextualizing user goals and walking through the steps taken by the user
    - "Storyboards" are visual representations of user interactions with a product, and can be sketches, illustrations, screenshots, slideshows, animations, or live demos
      - Created by defining the persona, the environment they are in, adn the plot of what they want to achieve
    - "Wireframes" are visual representations of the user interface, primarily concerned with the placement and hierarchy of content and functionalities
    - "Customer journey maps" illustrate the interaction experience of user research participants
      - The top describes the participant and their expectations
        - The "actor" is the persona and point of view for the journey
        - The "scenario" and "expectations" describe the journey and is associated with the actor's goal or need and expectations
      - The map in the middle is a table where the columns are sequential actions taken during the interaction and there is a row for each type of communication made by the user (doing, thinking, saying, feeling)
        - "Journey phases" are the stages (columns)
        - "Actions", "attitudes", and "emotions" are the actor's behaviors in the stages, ideally direct quotes
      - The bottom is a description of opportunities and things to do
        - "Opportunities" are mapping insights into how the user experience can be improved based on the journey map
- "UI" (User Interface) refers to how people interface or communicate with each other and with products such as email, text messages, or printers
  - Users use interfaces to achieve tasks, such as receiving directions, taking online classes, or ordering food
  - "GUI" (Graphical User Interface) provides a visual interface through a screen for users to communicate with technology, and is often synonymous with "UI" in design
    - It's how information is structured, the icons, colors, text, shapes, and the information
    - It's what happens when you tap or click something
  - Interfaces are about tasks, such as driving where the user interface is the dashboard providing information and updating based on user actions such as pressing the gas pedal
  - Intuitiveness can be crucial in user interfaces, as providind the right information at the right time can be critical in some situations such as medical emergencies or natural disasters
  - "Digital design" encompasses several types of design: UI design, UX design, CX design, and service design
    - "Service design" takes into account all points-of contact between a company and customers, both analog and digital
    - "CX design" (Customer Experience design) is about all interactions between the service provider and customer for a particular service or brand
    - "UX design" (User Experience design) is about interactions between user and a specific touchpoint
    - "UI design" (User Interface design) is about the usability, conversion, look and feel etc. of interfaces
  - "User-centered design" (UCD) is an iterative process that keeps the user centered throughout the process by considering the needs, wants, and limitations of end-users at each stage of the design process
- "Design thinking" is a process for solving creative problems consisting of the five phases: emphasize, define, ideate, prototype and test
  - "Emphasize" means to relate to the problem that is being solved
  - "Define" means to analyze and synthesize observations into a problem statement of what the user wants and why they want it
  - "Ideate" means to think about how to solve the problem statement
  - "Prototype" means a draft of the solution at any level of fidelity
  - "Test" means involving users with the prototype to test if it solves the problem statement, and then repeating this design cycle with the feedback
