- "Middleware" in Laravel acts as a filter/gatekeeper for incoming HTTP requests
  - Performs actions before or after a request reaches the application's routes or controllers
  - Defined as classes that inherit from the `Illuminate/Http/Middleware/Middleware` class
    - Should contain a `handle()` method that will be executed when the middleware is triggered
      - `use Illuminate/Support/Facades/Log` will add the support package for adding to the generated log, which is stored in `/storage/logs/laravel.log`
        - `Log::debug('Success')` would add the string `'Success'` to the log
        - `Log::debug($request -> header())` would add the request headers to the log
      - The route can be directed to another route with `return redirect('otherRoute')` through a conditional that checks a value in the request headers
    - Middleware classes can be assigned to routes or groups of routes, and are registered in `/app/Http/Kernel.php`
      - Middleware groups are divided into `'web' => []` and `'api' => []`
      - Middleware is registered in `middlewareAliases = []` with `'alias' =>` pointing to the Middleware class, which can be attached to a Route in `/routes/` with `Route -> middleware('alias')`
    - `php artisan make:middleware MiddlewareName` uses Artisan to create a middleware template file in `/app/Http/Middleware/` 
  - Commonly used for tasks such as authentication, authorization, caching, logging
    - There are several authentication methods provided by Laravel
      - "HTTP Basic Authentication" can be used to authenticate users to a REST API
      - "Form-based Authentication" is a traditional login form for authenticating users
      - "OAuth 2" allows users to authenticate using third-party services such as Google or Facebook
      - Middleware works together with autentication in Laravel to authenticate users
          - Used for protecting routes and restricting access based on authentication
          - Middleware classes used for authentication should have descriptive names
          - Multiple middleware classes can be combined to implement complex authentication schemes, such as user credentials authentication combined with two-factor authentication
      - Authentication in Laravel requires a `guard` class which is responsible for authenticating users. Laravel includes several built-in guards, such as "session guard" and "API guard"
        - Guards need to be registered in the `auth.php` configuration file, which contains a guard key used to register guards that authenticate users
        - `auth()` is a method called to use a registered guard
    - Custom middleware can be created to perform specific tasks, such as logging requests or verifying API tokens
    - Laravel offers authorization logic for controlling access to resources based on user roles and permissions
    - "Laravel Passport" is an OAuth2 server for issuing API authentication tokens securely
- The "Blade Templating System" is a templating engine that embeds PHP within HTML templates, to create dynamic and data-driven views for web applications
  - Blade templates are PHP files with the `.blade.php` extension, and are typically stored in `resources/views/`
    - Blade is used through the inclusion of Blade directives in PHP files
    - Descriptive names should be used for Blade templates, so they are easy to find and use
    - Templates are more reusable and flexible when they use Blade directives to generate dynamic HTML content
    - Master templates can be extended by other templates, and are created using Blade layouts
    - Blade templates should be documented so they are easy to maintain and understand
  - The syntax is straightforward with code such as `{{ $variable }}` to output a value
    - Conditionals can be declared with `@if` and `@endif`
    - Control structures can be declared with `@foreach` or `@while`
    - "Directives" can be declared for common tasks such as `@include` for including content from other files, `@extends` for extending existing Blade templates in new layouts, `@section` for content sections, and `@yield` for displaying content from sections
  - "Master layouts" can be created, and then extended in child views, to maintain a consistent structure and design across the application
  - "Sub-views" and "partials" can be included in main views, to reuse components such as headers, footers, and sidebars
  - Blade automatically escapes variables to prevent "Cross-Site Scripting" (XSS) attacks
    - Variables can be unescaped using the `@raw` directive
- "Laravel Vite" plugin bundles the Laravel project for deployment in a production environment
